# CAR_PRICE_PREDICTION
 Developed a Car Price Predictor using Linear  Regression, incorporating key features such as car  company name, model, fuel type, and kilometers  traveled to accurately estimate vehicle prices.  Leveraged Jupyter for data preprocessing and model  training, and PyCharm for integrating the model into  a full-fledged web application.
